    "## Recipe Rating Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we are going to use a dataset of recipes and their ratings, taken from [the website Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset contains basic information about the dish (its name, description, ingredients, and directions), as well as nutritional content (calories, protein, sodium, and fat contents). Based on this information, we want to try and predict how well or poorly the dish will be rated by users.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Grading Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "This midterm will be worth 15% of your total grade for this course. It will be graded out of 50 points, divided into 4 sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Data Prep: 10 points\n",
    "    - 5 points will be awarded for the actual data cleaning (evaluating your Python code)\n",
    "    - 5 points will be awarded for the text commentary narrating your choices and explaining your rationale for the data quality checks that you chose to use\n",
    "  - Feature Engineering: 12 points\n",
    "    - 2 points will be awarded by default, but may be subtracted from if there are substantial errors in your data prep that reduce the quality of your engineered features\n",
    "    - 5 points will be awarded for the actual feature engineering (evaluating your Python code)\n",
    "    - 5 points will be awarded for the text commentary narrating your choices and explaining your rationale\n",
    "  - Model Building: 14 points\n",
    "    - 4 points will be awarded by default, but may be subtracted from if there are substantial errors in your feature engineering that reduce the quality of your model\n",
    "    - 5 points will be awarded for the actual model building (evaluating your Python code)\n",
    "    - 5 points will be awarded for the text commentary narrating your choices and explaining your rationale\n",
    "  - Model Validation/Evaluation: 14 points\n",
    "    - 4 points will be awarded by default, but may be subtracted from if there are substantial errors in your model building that negatively impact the validity of your model\n",
    "    - 5 points will be awarded for the actual model validation and evaluation (evaluating your Python code)\n",
    "    - 5 points will be awarded for the text commentary narrating your choices and explaining your rationale\n",
