    "The Fashion MNIST dataset is a large freely available database of fashion images that is commonly used for training and testing various machine learning systems. Fashion-MNIST was intended to serve as a replacement for the original MNIST database for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, as it shares the same image size, data format and the structure of training and testing splits.\n",

The training set consists of 60,000 images and the test set consists of 10,000 images. The dataset is commonly included in standard machine learning libraries.
